Transform your React app with our state management library! Declare global and local states like variables, powered by the magic of React hooks ðŸª„âœ¨

## Features & Advantages
- Simple, familiar, flexible and very minimal core API but powerful
- Built-in support for state persistence
- Very easy to learn because its API is very similar to react state hook's API
- Support selecting deeply nested state
- Support creating state dynamically
- Can be used outside react components
- Doesn't wrap your app in context providers
- Very organized API, You can do almost everything with a single import


## State Flow
1. Create a state

2. Subscribe a component(s) to the state created

3. If a component wants to update the state, it sends update request

4. When a state receives update request, it performs the update and send signal to all components subscribed to it for them to update themselves(re-render)
